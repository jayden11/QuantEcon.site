We are looking for a computer science student with backend server/linux skills to help build a user
content generated platform for the QuantEcon project based at The Australian National University,
Research School of Economics. This project involves a contract for initial build, testing, and launch
of the web platform. We are also interested in issuing a subsequent ongoing maintenance contract
addressing issues and developing new functionality and features over the next 12 to 24 months.

The QuantEcon notebook archive is a web based platform with the aim to encourage international
collaboration and discussion in economics using Jupyter notebooks. We are currently developing a
fully functional front end prototype (using Javascript and CSS) and a detailed function specification
to help guide the successful applicant to develop the backend server software. The aim is to design
a robust and scalable platform based on the Amazon AWS stack. The successful applicant would
work with our key web designer, along with the QuantEcon team, and have the opportunity to
identify and define key technologies that would be used on the server side.
