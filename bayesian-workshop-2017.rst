Workshop on Bayesian Modeling with Jim Savage
==========================================================

**Time**: 1:15pm - 5pm

**Date**: June 19, 2017

**Venue**: Fred Gruen Seminar Room, H.W. Arndt Building (Building 25A), Australian National University

In this afternoon workshop, participants will be given an introduction to the Stan modeling language.

Stan is a flexible modeling language capable of performing efficient Bayesian inference on any model
with a continuous parameter space for which we can evaluate a (log) likelihood. It implements a
cutting-edge variety of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which will happily work with tens of thousands of
parameters, and often produces reliable estimates with only a few hundred iterations. It is currently
possible to call Stan from within R, Python, Julia, Mathematica, MATLAB, Stata, or at the command line.

The workshop:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* 1.15 - 2:00 A brief introduction to Stan.

  * What it is, how programs are set up, how to call them.
  * Exploring model fits in Shinystan

* 2:00 - 3:00 A modern statistical workflow. This workflow helps researchers iterate towards richer, higher quality models with less pain. We’ll use a simple time-varying-parameters AR model as the example.
* 3:15 - 5:00 Working through a more complex model. We’ll deploy the workflow on a model that is known to be fairly hard to fit: aggregate random coefficient logit (AKA BLP).


Pre-requisites:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Participants should have R, R Studio and Stan installed (we will only use R to
run and evaluate models; participants needn’t be proficient in R).

* R may be installed from `cran.r-project.org <http://cran.r-project.org/>`__
* R Studio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
* Stan from Cran. You will need to follow the installation instructions here, depending on your system:
